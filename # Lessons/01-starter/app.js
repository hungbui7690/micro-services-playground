  Starter
  - we have 2 services: 
    # orders
    # inventory

  ðŸ¥Œ Now, each microservice has its own server and listens on a different port. To start both microservices, open two terminals, navigate to each microservice directory, and run node app.js.

  cd orders
  npm run dev

  cd inventory
  npm run dev
